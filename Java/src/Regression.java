/*
 * This is the java module to run regression and is a multithreaded module.
 * It is advised to be cautious about the code push since if now monitored 
 * properly then the code which is pushed can crash the process management of 
 * the operating system and can crash it. Also there is a possibility that 
 * a not code which is written casually can mess with the other program which 
 * is running in java jvm. So it is mandated to check it thoroughly with the 
 * architect or author of this module before pushing it to the build.
